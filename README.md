# J3Util

A Roblox Utility Library

## USAGE OF ROJO IS SLIGHTLY DISCOURAGED FOR THIS PROJECT

This project's Rojo version is mainly for if you're running a fork of it, and for me when testing.
To actually use this library, I strongly suggest using `require(7162009730)` instead.
Autocomplete is fucked anyway, so it's not really helpful to use rojo for this project (you can still use `require(7162009730)` in an existing rojo project - i am not saying don't use rojo, but rather, don't put this in your codebase)

### but it is possible

run `git submodule add git@github.com:0J3/J3Util.git` wherever you want this repo to be in your codebase

from there, just require it's main modulescript (**NOT** any of its many nested ones - those aren't intended for direct calling)
